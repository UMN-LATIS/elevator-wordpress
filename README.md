# Elevator Wordpress Plugin

This plugin uses the [Elevator](http://github.com/umn-latis/elevator) API to make it easier to embed assets in WordPress.  In order to do the initial setup, you'll need an elevator API key, as supplied by an administrator.  

To install, download a zipped copy of the plugin from the Releases page, and install in your wordpress site.  Then configure within the plugin preferences.  Real instructions coming soon.
